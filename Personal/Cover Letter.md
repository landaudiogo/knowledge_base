To whom it may concern,

I am writing to apply for the PhD position on Performance Observability in Edge-to-Cloud Continuum, within the department of Information and Computing Sciences, at Utrecht University. This opening was first presented to me by Professor Nishant Saurabh, after having defended my Master thesis to 3 jury members, one of which being the Professor.

During my Master's degree, I had the opportunity to work part-time at several fast paced technological companies, which provided a unique opportunity to work in several Software departments, ranging between Analytics, to Software development and Data Engineering. This experience proved to be extremely valuable throughout my master thesis, as it involved a combination of the these three areas, and a deep dive into the vast DevOps ecosystem. 

The goal of my thesis was to determine the required parallelism of a group of consumers in a message broker environment, which, due to the nature of how data is produced in these environments, required continuous monitoring of data throughput, and autoscaling features for the group of consumers to adapt with the amount of data being produced. This involved a thorough investigation of both Kafka and Kubernetes with a critical view, which lead to the creation of new load balancing techniques for a group of consumers and a deterministic approach to provide the number of instances required to achieve the necessary amount of parallelism. This solution is currently being used by the company (Maersk - HUUB).

The Master thesis proved to be an invaluable experience that revealed both my capabilities of persistent research and my interest in doing so. There are not many opportunities where one can follow a newly found possible thread, simply because it seems like it might contribute to our work, but research is one of these opportunities, and one of the many reasons why I express my interest for this field. 

Although not formally hired by academia, I have always been attracted toward sharing my knowledge, having had 5 years of experience in tutoring math to students who are preparing to enter university via the International Baccalaureate program. This stood as a test to my capacity to understand other perspectives while attempting to explain the same concept in the different ways required by students, which inherently comes with any tutoring position. Having been successful in doing so, to assist Professor Nishant Saurabh in his teaching capacities, would match the progression I have been searching for when it comes to tutoring.

Lastly, provided my experience in the different software areas, and the soft and hard skils my master thesis provided me with, as a candidate, I fully meet the expectations and requirements mentioned in the job advertisement. Enclosed is my CV, and a paper which is to be published related to the work I did throughout my master thesis.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response,
Diogo Landau
