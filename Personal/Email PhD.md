Dear Dr. Nishant Saurabh,

Thank you for having accepted to be the main reviewer of my thesis "Event Driven Publish/Subscribe Consumer Group Autoscaling". Your questions were extremely well adressed, and allowed me to focus on them on an article I am now doing for the work developed in my thesis.

As I said at the end of the defense, I am also considering my options as to whether I want to continue my work in the academic field, by pursuing a PhD. I would like to know whether your offer still stands to do a PhD at Ultrecht under your supervision, and if so, I would like to better understand the grant's conditions.

Best regards, 
Diogo Landau
