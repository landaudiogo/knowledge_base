Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit.

The abstractions in Kubernetes allow you to deploy containerized applications to a cluster without tying them specifically to individual machines.

Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in a more efficient way.

A kubernetes cluster consists of 2 types of resources: 
-   The **Control Plane** coordinates the cluster
-   **Nodes** are the workers that run applications

## Control Plane

**The Control Plane is responsible for managing the cluster.** The Control Plane coordinates all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.

## Nodes

**A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.** Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes control plane. The node should also have tools for handling container operations, such as containerd or Docker. A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a minimum of three nodes.
