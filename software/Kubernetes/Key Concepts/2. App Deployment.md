Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your containerized applications on top of it. To do so, you create a Kubernetes **Deployment** configuration. The Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of your application. Once a deployment is created the control plane schedules the application instances included in that deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster.

Once the application instances are created the, a kubernetes deployment controller continuosly monitors the instances.  If the Node hosting an instance goes down or is deleted, the Deployment controller replaces the instance with an instance on another Node in the cluster. 

Deployments can be created and managed using the kubernetes CLI, **Kubectl**. Kubectl uses the Kubernetes API to interact with the cluster.

## Creating a Deployment

When creating a deployment, the **image** and the number of **replicas** have to be specified. This information can be changed later by updating the Deployment.

## Overview

- Nodes are the machines that can run instances; 
- Instances run on Nodes; 
- Control Plane, runs the Deployment and manages the cluster, monitoring the instances state.
