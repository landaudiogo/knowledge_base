# Overview

Executes and tracks the different states defined for the controller.

# Attributes

`controller`: Controller instance

`initial`: initial state the State machine start in.

`current_state`: state in which the State machine finds itself in.

`states`: a map[str, State], representing states that the state machine tracks.

# Methods

`add_state(self, key, state)`: adds a state for the state machine to track.

`add_transition(self, function_transition, origin_key, destination_key)`: Adds a
transition that originates from the state pointed at by the origin_key, and ends
up in the state pointed at by the destination_key within the states map. The
transition is added to the list of transitions of the origin state.

`set_initial(self, key)`: set the `initial` attribute to the state pointed at by
the value passed by the `key` parameter.

`execute(self)`: If the state machine hasn't been initialized it initializes in
the `initial` state. After running the states `execute` method, the transitions
of the state are verified, and if one of the transitions is triggered, then the
`change_state` method of the state machine is ran.

`change_state(self, destination)`: Changes the state Machine state to the
state defined by the destination parameter. The exit function of the current
state, and the entry function of the destination state are also executed.

`initialize(self)`: Initialize the State machine and execute the initial state's
entry function.
