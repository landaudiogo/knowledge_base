# Overview

Concrete implementation of the State Class, which models the controller's
Sentinel State. 

When in this state, the controller consumed data from the
data-engineering-monitor topic, and based on the values read, it updates the
consumer group partitions to their new measured speed values.

If there is any partitions that hasn't been assigned, or if the combined speed
of the partitions assigned to a consumer has exceeded its capacity, or if the
elapsed time in this state has exceeded the predefined value by `MAX_TIME_S1`, a
state change is triggered to then perform the reassignment algorithm.

# Methods

`time_up(self)`: trigger_function to verify whether the elapsed time of this
state is bigger than `MAX_TIME_S1`.

`full_bin(self)`: Verifies whether any consumer in the controller's
consumer_list has its capacity exceeded by its current assignment combined
speed.

`any_unassigned(self)`: Verifies whether there is any partition that hasn't yet
been assigned.

`entry(self)`: initializes the variables the state requires to function
correctly.

`execute(self)`: fetches the last measured partition speeds and updates the
partitions within the consumer_list's assignments, and if the partition is not
assigned to a consumer, it is added to the controller's unassigned_partitions
list.
