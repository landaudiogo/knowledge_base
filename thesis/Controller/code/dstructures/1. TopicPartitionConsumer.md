# Overview

Emulate the TopicPartition class provided by Kafka, but with the purpose of tracking the partition unique identifier, and the measured speed by the Monitor. 

To allow sorting a list of instances of this type, this class is wrapped with `functools.total_ordering`.

# Attributes

`topic`: string identifying the topic's name.
`partition`: Integer that indicates the partition id within a single topic.
`speed`: the partition's write speed.



# Methods 

`__hash__(self)`: Allows an instance of this type to be mapped as a key into a dictionary or a set in python, combined with the `__eq__` method.
`__eq__(self, other)`: Compares whether the instance of this class (`self`) is equal to the `other` object.
`__lt__(self, other)`:  Verifies whether self is smaller than other. The partition write speed is what indicates whether a partition is smaller than another.
`__repr__(self)`: string representation of an instance of this class.
`copy(self)`: Method that provides a copy of the calling instance without a reference to the caller. 
`update_speed(self, value)`: updates the calling instance to the speed passed on in value.
