# Overview

wraps the dict internal type to specifically map consumers to the Messages that
have to be sent to it.

# Methods

`add_action(self, action)`: If the consumer referenced in the action already
exists within the calling instance, the action is simply added to the `ConsumerMessage`
instance that represents it's value. Otherwise, the consumer is creeated, and
assigned a new `ConsumerMessage` instance, and the action is added to the new
instance.
