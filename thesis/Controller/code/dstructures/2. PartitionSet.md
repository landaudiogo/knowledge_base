# Overview

A `set()` in python does not allow to get the instance within the set. As such, this class wraps the dict python datastructure, to create a structure similar to the set, which also allows to `get()` instances within the set using the unique identifiers of a partition (topic name string, and partition id).

# Attributes

# Methods

`__or__(self, other)`: Allows the use of the `|` operator between 2 instances of this class, to output a new `PartitionSet()` with the union of the 2 sets in the evaluation (`self`, `other`).
`__sub__(self, other)`: Allows the use of the `-` operator to compute the difference between 2 instances of this class. The output is the same as what is expected when performing the `-` operation between 2 instances of type `set` in python.
`add_partition(self, tp)`:  Adds a partition to the partition set.
`copy(self)`: copies the calling instance into a new instance of PartitionSet.
`__repr__(self)`: string representation of the calling object. An instance of type PartitionSet is represented as a set of the partitions that are contained within itself.
`to_list(self)`: adds the partitions within the calling instance into a list, and returns the list.
