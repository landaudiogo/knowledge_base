## Introduction

**partitions and queues are equivalent**

Throughout this paper, we consider a queue or partition to be a structure within a message broker environment where messages sent to it, are appended in the same order as they were produced. Therefore, this structure should optionally be capable  of delivering the messages in the same order as they were produced.

**Dar melhor contexto**
To guarantee state consistency between two distinct distributed systems, the order in which messages are consumed by a process has to be the same as to how they were produced for a specific business related entity. (??falta aqui qq coisa) Kafka and RabbitMQ, have different ways of handling this scenario.

Within Kafka, all the messages produced to a partition are appended and delivered in the same order as they were published. Messages can be consistently produced to the same partition if the same key is used \cite{}.

As for RabbitMQ, it guarantees messages within a queue are enqueued in the same order as they were produced. Therefore, to guarantee same order message delivery, only a single consumer can be reading messages from the queue \cite{}.

> https://www.rabbitmq.com/queues.html#message-ordering

**Garantir que a taxa de leitura acompanha a taxa de produção**

Within a distributed message broker environment, provided we are given a set of independent queues, our goal is to manage a group of consumers, so as to guarantee the rate of consumption is at least as high as the production rate. 

Since message ordering is important, only one consumer can be assigned a queue, but multiple queues can be assigned the same consumer. This also implies that the maximum number of consumers is limited to the number of queues.

As each consumer represents an active computing resource, while attempting to determine the amount of parallelism required, we are also aiming to minimize the operational cost, by reducing the number of consumers. 

Considering consumers as bins, and queues as items that have to be assigned a bin, this problem was modeled as a new variation of the Bin Packing (BP) Problem, with the particularity that items vary in size with time. This occurs because a queue's size correlates to its current write speed, which fluctuates based on the current system's load and inevitably implies that a BP solution for a given time instant may not hold true in future instants. 

On account of this BP variation, a new solution has to be computed at different time instants, each having different information as to the size of each item (each queue's "current" write speed). This might lead to a queue (item) being assigned to a different consumer (bin) when compared to the consumer group's previous configuration when it was last computed. 

Since two consumers cannot read from the same queue concurrently, there is another cost to take into account associated to rebalancing a partition. This cost is related to the amount of data that is not being read while the queue is being assigned from one consumer to another.

**Lacking current solutions**

Given that it is the first time the Bin Packing Problem is applied in this context, existing algorithms do not take this rebalance cost into account. Hence, in Section \ref{} we propose a metric to account for a given iteration's rebalance cost (Rscore). Additionally, using the Rscore, in Section \ref{} we propose four new BP heuristic algorithms that account for the rebalance costs, three of which prove to be a competitive alternative to the multi-objective problem at hand \ref{}.

**Other applications of this model**

Furthermore, it is our belief that this model is applicable in other contexts, e.g., the Kubernetes node autoscaling problem. In Kubernetes, nodes are machines that have resources, to which pods are assigned. Each pod is independent and the node resources it consumes varies with time. Therefore, modeling nodes as bins and pods as items whose size varies over time, this problem also fits our variation of the BP problem, with the added complexity of bins being allowed to have different sizes, which is not considered in our scenario.

Applies the BPP to the virtual machine placement problem, with loads that can vary dynamically (variable item size). They allow reallocating VMs to other physical machines to reduce the number of active machines or to reduce the overload on an overprovisioned machine. The rebalance cost for their problem depends on the memory footprint of the running VM, and therefore migrating smaller VMs is preferred.

They study the reallocation problem to increase the energy efficiency in cloud infrastructure. They use a reallocation controller which is executed periodically re-compute the VM to PM assignment, while simultaneously minimizing the used PMs cost, and the VM migration cost. They also consider the items' sizes may vary between computations.

Wolke et al. \cite{wolke2015more} and Song et al. \cite{song2013adaptive}, study the impact of periodically computing their bin packing algorithm due to VMs having variable loads over time, and therefore variable item sizes. They model their problem as a variable item size variant of the bin packing problem, with items that can be migrated from one Physical machine (PM) to another. They found that by periodically running their bin packing solver, they managed to reduce the operational cost, when compared to accepting the initial assignment of a VM to a PM. Both also consider there is a cost to rebalancing a VM to a different PM, related to the memory footprint of a VM signaled for migration.

With real-time data streaming, a new paradigm of data processing has emerged, which has the compute nodes process the data in real-time, as opposed to batch processing the data periodically. In more detail, when processing data in real-time, a query is executed "continuously" to provide with real-time insights as soon as a new tuple is provided. As Gulisano et al. \cite{gulisano2012streamcloud} point out, a continuous query can be construcuted as a direct acyclic graph, where the different operators can be distributed to different nodes, having upstream nodes communicating with their downstream conterparts to communicate the result of its query. This also enables for a distributed execution of a query, and an elastic infrastructure capable of scaling based on the current system's load. The authors use utilization thresholds to determine how to scale its cluster of nodes.

Heinze et al. \cite{heinze2013elastic}, use bin packing to dynamically scale in or out a set of nodes based on the current system's query load, while maintaining process latency constraints. The authors observed underutilization, due to query operators no longer occupying computing resources in host machines after task completion, and therefore, devised a re-balance policy. They acknowledge re-executing the bin packing heuristic would provide with better utilization rates, but in their scenario this was not feasible due to excessive re-balance cost, and therefore devise a re-balancing algorithm that re-places only the operators that present minimal load in their system, until a specific condition is met.

As a complement to the previous findings, \cite{heinze2014auto} extends the algorithm to use reinforcement learning to improve the decision to scale out or scale in, based on the utilization rates and latency measurements.
