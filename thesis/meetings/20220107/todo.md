# General


Generalize the problem as much as we can so it can be identifiable within other contexts. There is no need to bind the problem to Kafka that much.

Check the abbreviations.

# Introduction

# Bin Packing Problem

# Infrastructure

Additional contribution where we model the problem as a BPP. 

# Consumer Group Autoscaler

Why did we choose 500 iterations? More measurements, implies bigger reliability on the results of the performance of the algorithms.

Add unit to delta (seconds) 

Determine whether the response time is acceptable or not -> Write about it in the business scope. what is the consume latency from the moment of production to the moment of consumption. And what if we don't adapt, what happens to the same measures? the cost? and the QoS? And if the adaption is made manually.

# Integration

# Future Work

Study heuristics using the Rscore as a second objective function (multi-objective).
