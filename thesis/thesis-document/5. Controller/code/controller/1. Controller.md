# Overview

This class aims to model the controller that has to control and orchestrate the
consumer group based on collected metrics from the kafka cluster.

# Attributes

`monitor_consumer`: `data-engineering-monitor` consumer. The consumer is
assigned from the beginning the last message in the topic.

`controller_consumer`: `data-engineering-controller` consumer for the partition
with `id = 0` since it represents the controllers message_queue.

`state_machine`: controls the state in which the controller finds itself, and
what it has to execute.

`unassigned_partitions`: partitions that have yet to be assigned to the consumer
group.

`consumer_list`: the consumer group represented as a list.

`next_assignment`: attribute set by the reassignment algorithm.

# Methods

`get_last_monitor_record(self)`: using the `monitor_consumer`, gets the last
message that is on the `data-engineering-monitor` topic.

`run(self)`: infinite loop that triggers the start of the state machine.
