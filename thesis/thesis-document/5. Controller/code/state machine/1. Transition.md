# Overview

This class represents a transition between 2 states. 

# Attributes

`origin`: state in which the controller finds itself, that verifies the
transition.

`destination`: state to which the controller changes, in case the transition is
True.

`trigger_function`: Function that takes no input, and returns either True or
False. 

# Methods

`__call__(self)`: allows the Transition instance to be callable, and returns
None if the trigger function returns False, or it returns the destination state
otherwise.
