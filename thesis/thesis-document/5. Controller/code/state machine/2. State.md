# Overview

Base class from which any state has to derive from.

# Attributes

`controller`: Controller instance.

`transitions`: Transition list that originate from the calling State instance.

# Methods

`entry(self)`: Entry action that is performed when the state machine changes
into the calling instance. This is only executed on entry, and not while
executing the state.

`elapsed_time(self)`: Time that has passed since the controller changed into the
calling state instance.

`exit(self)`: When the state machine changes to another state, the source state
from which the controller changes executes the exit actions defined in this
function.

`execute(self)`: To be implemented by any class that inherits from State.

`add_transition(self, transition)`: Add a transition to the list of transitions
that originate from the calling State instance.

`verify_transitions(self)`: Verify whether any of the transitions in the
`transitions` attribute is triggered. If any of the transitions is triggered,
then the destination state is returned, otherwise it returns None.
