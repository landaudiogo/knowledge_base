# Overview

Deals with the consumer group management, after computing the diference between
the current and next assignment. This state only terminates after the consumer
group has reached the state defined by the controller's `next_assignment`
attribute.


# Attributes

`FINAL_GROUP_STATE`: Indicates whether the consumer group finds itself in the
final state. If None, the controller does not find itself in this state.

# Methods

`entry(self)`: sets the variables to their initial state before starting
execution.

`exit(self)`: resets the variables into an undefined state to identify when not
executing.

`group_reached_state(self)`: trigger function to be used by a transition to
change to another state.

`execute(self)`: This function executes the following procedure.
  1. Compute the difference between the next and current assignment
  2. Create the consumers that don't exist yet
  3. Send the batch of messages.
  4. As the event is received, prepare a new batch and send it to the consumer
     group. Repeat from 3 until there are no more actions to be sent.
  5. Delete the consumers that don't have to exist anymore.
