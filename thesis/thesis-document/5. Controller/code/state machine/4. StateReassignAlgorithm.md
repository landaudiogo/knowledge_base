# Overview

Class that deals with assigning partitions to consumers. There are several
methods of assignment that can be used to determine the next assignment, and it
is done using a Factory method, which selects the Approximation algorithm based
on the string passed.

# Attributes

`ALGORITHM_STATUS`: Boolean which represents the status in which the calling
State instance finds itself in. If set to None, the state is not active, whereas
False represents the Algorithm is in execution, and True, the algorithm has
terminated.

# Methods

`entry(self)`: Sets the state variables to their initial state when the state
starts executing.

`exit(self)`: Resets the variable into an undefined state.

`execute(self)`: Runs the specified approximation algorithm, and assigns the
controller with the new assignment to the attribute `next_assignment`

`finished_approximation_algorithm(self)`: trigger function to be used to indicate the
state in which the approximation algorithm finds itself.
