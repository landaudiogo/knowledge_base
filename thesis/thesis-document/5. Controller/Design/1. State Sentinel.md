The sentinel has the task of overviewing the partition speed and triggering the start of the reassignment algorithm for all partitions the data engineering consumer group is interested in.

After initialization, the controller enters immediately into this state to determine whether the algorithm has to be triggered.

To configure the controller, there are the following variables:
- `MAX_TIME_S1`: Defines the maximum amount of time that can pass since the algorithm last ran. This is in essence the amount of time the controller spent in the first state.

The triggers are: 
- time since the controller entered the first state exceeds `MAX_TIME_S1`.
- There is one or more partitions that have not been assigned a consumer. 
- The combined speed of the partitions assigned to one or more consumers

Tasks:

1. Read the last message added to the monitor topic
2. Measure the time since the beginning of the first state.
3. Define the data model to have a mapping from consumer to the partitions it is currently assigned to.
4. Determine the combined speed of each consumer (this represents the sum of the speeds of the partitions assigned to each consumer).
