# Overview

This is the state of the process that runs the algorithm which will define the current assignment for all the consumers within the consumer group.

# Algorithm 

## Input 

Consumer current assignment, and the partitions that have yet to be assigned consumers. It is important to note that each partition whether assigned or not, has associated to it the current write speed as measured by the monitor process.

## Output

This algorithm outputs the future assignment for the consumer group.

## Goals

1. Deterministically provide with the amount of consumers that have to be provisioned for all the partitions to be assigned a consumer.
2. Tries to reduce the amount of partitions that are rebalanced.
3. In case there is rebalancing, attempt to keep the partitions with greater write speed in the current consumer, and the ones with least, be the partitions that are reassigned. 


# Tasks

1. Define the Modified algorithm procedure.
2. Apply approximation algorithms of the bin packing algorithm.
3. Apply approximation algorithms of the bin packing algorithm with modification.
